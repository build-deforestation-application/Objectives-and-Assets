# Proposal

---

- What problem does your app solve?

  - The Deforestation Dashboard gives users insight into how the world's forests are changing – where forest cover is declining and where it is actually increasing.

- Be as specific as possible; how does your app solve the problem?

  - By displaying information in a digestable dashboard

- What is the mission statement?

  - The Deforestation Dashboard gives users insight into how the world's forests are changing

  - User registration/login flow
  - User can add an area (country, forest, etc), they would like to get data on, to their profile
  - User can submit a form to the DS api to get data for a specific point in time.
  - User can save all of the queries to the DS api for a given area to the Web backend
  - User can edit the name of the saved areas
  - User can delete saved areas

- What features may you wish to put in a future release?

  - Visualize the changes over time for any given area
  - Partner with similar local or international organizations.
  - Media integration

- What do the top 3 similar apps do for their users?
  - Show you how dangerous an area is
  - Show you where to focus your prevention efforts
  - Where not to camp

# Design - Planning

---

_Optional but highly recommended_
_Please refer to this document:_

[Build Weeks: Planning & Design Worksheet (How to build a beautiful application)](https://www.notion.so/aabd4ef25a184a2085e511ce93480c0f)

- What design system will you use?

  - Figma

- What will your user flow be?

  - Landing Page -> Dashboard

- What is the URL to your wireframes?

  - NA

# Frameworks - Libraries

---

- What 3rd party frameworks/libraries are you considering using?
  DS: Anaconda, Flask || Plotly
  WEB: Google Maps, Axios, Formik / Yup, UI libs, Redux(thunk, logger)
  BE: ?? Express / JWT?

- Do APIs require you to contact its maintainer to gain access?
  Na

- Are you required to pay to use the API?
  Maybe

- Have you considered using Apple Frameworks? (MapKit, Healthkit, ARKit?)
  Never

# For Data Scientists

---

- Describe the Established data source with at least rough data able to be provided on day 1.

`https://data.mongabay.com/deforestation.htm https://rainforests.mongabay.com/defor_index.htm https://ourworldindata.org/forests https://databank.worldbank.org/data/reports.aspx?source=2&series=AG.LND.FRST.ZS For government changes stretch goal: https://oefresearch.org/datasets/reign"`

- You can gather information about the data set you’ll be working with from the project description. Be sure to collaborate with your PM, and your Backend Architect to chat about the resources you have.

- Write a description for what the DS problem is (what uncertainty/prediction are we trying to do here? Sentiment analysis? Why is this a useful solution to a problem?)

- A target (e.g. JSON format or such) for output that DS students can deliver to web/other students for them to ingest and use in the app
  - json

# Target Audience

---

- Who is your target audience? Be specific.

- What feedback have you gotten from potential users?

- Have you validated the problem and your solution with your target audience? How?

## Research

---

- Research thoroughly before writing a single line of code. Solidify the features of your app conceptually before implementation. Spend the weekend researching so you can hit the ground running on Monday.

# Prototype Key Feature(s)

---

- This is the “bread and butter” of the app, this is what makes your app yours. Calculate how long it takes to implement these features and triple the time estimated. That way you’ll have plenty of time to finish. It is preferred to drop features and spend more time working on your MVP features if needed.
